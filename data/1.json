    "description": "Powered by an automatic movement the Khaki Aviation is available in 38mm and 42mm to fit every wrist. A range of straps from a metal bracelet to a soft khaki leather strap give the timepiece a look of adventure. The big numbers and indexes recall the pilotâ€™s necessity to read watches with ease during turbulence."
